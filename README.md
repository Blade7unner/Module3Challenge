# Module3Challenge

## This is my Module 3 challenge for week 3.

## In this code:

## Version #1 ##
1. We define the character set as lowercase letters.
2. We create a function getRandomLowercaseChar to retrieve a random lowercase character.
3. The generatePassword function generates a random password with a fixed length (in this case, 10 characters) using only lowercase characters.
4. The generated password is displayed in the text area when the "Generate Password" button is clicked.
